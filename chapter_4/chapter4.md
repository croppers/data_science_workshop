Please check out the Binder project, which is available at https://jupyter.org/binder
* Binders are an easy way for you to share your code with others.
* Users do not need to set up a Python environment on their machines.
* All that is required is a web browser!

Specifically, BinderHub is a great technology for this purpose. You can access the web app for BinderHub at https://mybinder.org 
1. Upload your Jupyter notebook to a GitHub Repo
2. Upload your requirements.txt file (See Chapter 1) to the same Repo
3. Copy the URL and paste it into the Binder.
4. Click 'Launch'

That's it! Now, sit back and wait for BinderHub to generate your web-accessible notebook. Send it to your friends, or send it in the Discord community chat to share your hard work during this track.
